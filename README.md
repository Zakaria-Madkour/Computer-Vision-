# This is a Mars rover computer vision project
## Steps to run the code on your local machine
1. Create the environment found in cv1.txt using anaconda to include all the packages required
2. To allow for the real-time debugging mode set the flag show_pipeline in perception.py to true
3. Run the pyhon file drive_rover.py
4. Start the simulator.
## Important Note:
---
It is worth noting that in case you run the code in the debugging mode each phase of the pipeline will appear in a distinctive window with the title of the window representing the stage of the pipeline
#### Once you run the simulator it will automatically link to the server crated in drive_rover.py. The simulator will automatically send data to the python script running (server) and when the server finishes its processing and decision making it will send the control data to the simulator.
